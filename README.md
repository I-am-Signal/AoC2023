# Advent of Code 2023 Puzzle Completions
I will post my AoC code puzzle completions when I get around to completing them here.
I will be behind, maybe even by a week. I plan to complete as many as I can when I am able to do so.

# Learning Plans
During this code puzzle event, I plan to write these programs in programming languages that I am not familiar with so I can learn them with these coding puzzles.

# Event
You can find the event here if you would like to participate:
